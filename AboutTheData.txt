Our group found this data in Kaggle. Kaggle is an online community website for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts 
and practitioners that allows its users to communicate and exchange ideas, collaborate with one another, and publish and share 
datasets. Our group decided that this website would be practical and useful in providing a rich and abundant dataset for this 
project. After downloading the dataset we used Excel to have a starting understanding of what the data conveys. These two applications 
allowed us to see how the data looks like and what the dataset contains. To do our coding and create graphs and models, we used Anaconda 
and Jupyter Notebook. We wrote our code in Python and we used many different methods that we implemented to allow for us to create 
diagrams. The dataset is called "IPL Match Dataset 2008-2023: Complete Record". The dataset is about match records from the Indian
